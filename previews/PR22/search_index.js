Secondly, the methods themselves have a maximum step size which is allowed due to the stability requirement on the ODE solver. Thus the ODE solver should have a high enough order in order to make use of the efficiency gains, but if the order is too high then the h will need to be artificially decreased in order to ensure stability and accurate error approximations, and therefore there is a \"sweet spot\" where the order is high but not too high.","category":"page"},{"location":"lectures/lecture3/","page":"Solvers for Non-Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations","title":"Solvers for Non-Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations","text":"In practice, this has empirically been found to be between 3-9, though this can be very dependent on two things.

However, this workflow is tedious and not expressive. A simple change in the underlying physical system often requires a complete re-derivation of the simplified equations. A composable modeling system frees domain experts from the time-consuming derivation, simplification, and implementation by allowing them to model each physical component separately and hierarchically, thereby enabling them to build more accurate and complex models without compromising the simulation performance. In this course, we will dive into the practice of implementing composable physical models and the compilation process of the model system using the ModelingToolkit.jl acausal modeling framework in Julia. Students will learn the mathematics and numerical methods behind solving industry-scale models, covering topics such as differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), modern techniques in implicit integrators (backwards differentiation formulae (BDFs)), symbolic manipulation of equations via techniques like Pantelides algorithm and tearing of nonlinear systems, and more. Applications for solving real-world problems like modeling battery systems of electric vehicles, efficient control of hydraulic and HVAC systems, and more will be used to demonstrate how these techniques are used in industrial settings.","category":"page"},{"location":"syllabus/#Syllabus","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"syllabus/","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"Prerequisites: While this course will be mixing ideas from symbolic computing, numerical differential equations, and topics from mechanical engineering, no one in the course is expected to have covered all of these topics before.

It turns out that's not an issue if the phenomena we see are fast, since then the total integration time tends to be small. However, if we have some equations with both fast modes and slow modes, like the Robertson equation (shown below), then it is very difficult because in order to resolve the slow dynamics over a long timespan, one needs to ensure that the fast dynamics do not diverge. This is a property known as stiffness. Stiffness can thus be approximated in some sense by the condition number of the Jacobian. The condition number of a matrix is its maximal eigenvalue divided by its minimal eigenvalue and gives a rough measure of the local timescale separations. If this value is large and one wants to resolve the slow dynamics, then explicit integrators, like the explicit Runge-Kutta methods described before, have issues with stability.

The answer is essentially hydraulic modelling is really hard (in numerical computing terms, hydraulic models are often referred to as \"stiff\" ODE's, which require more rigorous solvers from standard ODE's).  Solving the challenges of modeling hydraulics is applicable to the numerical modeling challenges of all other domains.  Let's first start with the concept of compressibility.  Often we think of a liquid as incompressible, imagine attempting to \"squeeze\" water, it can be done but takes some very high forces.  Therefore, if the model in question won't be solving a problem with high forces, it can be assumed incompressible.
