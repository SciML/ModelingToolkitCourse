Secondly, the methods themselves have a maximum step size which is allowed due to the stability requirement on the ODE solver. Thus the ODE solver should have a high enough order in order to make use of the efficiency gains, but if the order is too high then the h will need to be artificially decreased in order to ensure stability and accurate error approximations, and therefore there is a \"sweet spot\" where the order is high but not too high.","category":"page"},{"location":"lectures/lecture3/","page":"Solvers for Non-Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations","title":"Solvers for Non-Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations","text":"In practice, this has empirically been found to be between 3-9, though this can be very dependent on two things.

However, this workflow is tedious and not expressive. A simple change in the underlying physical system often requires a complete re-derivation of the simplified equations. A composable modeling system frees domain experts from the time-consuming derivation, simplification, and implementation by allowing them to model each physical component separately and hierarchically, thereby enabling them to build more accurate and complex models without compromising the simulation performance. In this course, we will dive into the practice of implementing composable physical models and the compilation process of the model system using the ModelingToolkit.jl acausal modeling framework in Julia. Students will learn the mathematics and numerical methods behind solving industry-scale models, covering topics such as differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), modern techniques in implicit integrators (backwards differentiation formulae (BDFs)), symbolic manipulation of equations via techniques like Pantelides algorithm and tearing of nonlinear systems, and more. Applications for solving real-world problems like modeling battery systems of electric vehicles, efficient control of hydraulic and HVAC systems, and more will be used to demonstrate how these techniques are used in industrial settings.","category":"page"},{"location":"syllabus/#Syllabus","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"syllabus/","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"Prerequisites: While this course will be mixing ideas from symbolic computing, numerical differential equations, and topics from mechanical engineering, no one in the course is expected to have covered all of these topics before.

The Modelica library defines the base fluids class around the assumption of constant length (see: Object-Oriented Modeling of Thermo-Fluid Systems) and therefore adapting to a component that changes length is not possible.  But in cases with long actuators with high dynamics the pressure is not at all uniform, therefore this detail cannot be ignored.  Therefore, adding in the momentum balance to provide flow resistance and fluid inertia are necessary.  The diagram below shows the design of a DynamicVolume component which includes both mass and momentum balance in addition to discretization by volume.  The discretization is similar to the pipe, except the scheme becomes a bit more complicated with the moving wall (x).  As the volume shrinks, the control volumes will also shrink, however not in unison, but one at a time.  In this way, as the moving wall closes, the flow will come from the first volume cv1 and travel thru the full size remaining elements (cv2, cv3, etc.).  After the first component length drops to zero, the next element will then start to shrink.
